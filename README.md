## Components

### Extension Core (`background.js`)
- Monitors web navigation events
- Intercepts search queries from Safari's default search engine
- Redirects to Brave Search when enabled
- Uses `browser.storage.local` for state management

### Popup Interface
- **HTML (`popup.html`)**: Simple UI with toggle switch and status indicator
- **CSS (`popup.css`)**: Modern styling with system-native appearance
- **JavaScript (`popup.js`)**: Handles user interactions and state management

### Native Integration
- **SafariWebExtensionHandler**: Manages extension state and Safari integration
- Supports both iOS and macOS platforms
- Uses UserDefaults for persistent storage

## How It Works

1. **State Management**
   - Extension state (enabled/disabled) stored in `browser.storage.local`
   - Persists across browser sessions
   - Syncs between popup and background script

2. **Search Redirection**
   - Background script monitors navigation events
   - Detects search queries in URLs
   - When enabled, redirects to Brave Search with the same query

3. **User Interface**
   - Toggle switch to enable/disable redirection
   - Visual indicators for current state
   - Instant feedback on state changes
